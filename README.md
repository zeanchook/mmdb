I use figma sketch out rough idea what the movie app might like, and this serve as my initial idea.

So, after a week into the developement for the app, the final looks of the app looks like this.

## The Process

There's a lot to needs to be done within a week. So to start simple, I used Trello board to kick start the development process, here is the list of processes.

- Started by testing out the possible API that I will be using for this project, and track them by using Bruno.
- After that, I also test out by performing CREATE, UPDATE and PATCH to airtable as that will eventually be used in my code later.
- Set up react-router to list out all the possible pages I wish to show.
- Create components like "Home", "Top Rated", "Search box" etc as each of the components has its specific function.
- Code all individual components and test out their functionality.
- Separate out some of the fetch services as individual js files to tidy up.
- Clean up codes and remove any unnecessary comments.
- Finally, touch up the readme.

## API used

- [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api)
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com/)

### Future Development

- Add a notification in the wishlist if provider is available in the future.
- Add a clickable link that can direct user to provider.

### Summary

Developing everything from scratch can be challenging, but throughout this project, I've learned the importance of simplicity and building small functions that serve specific purposes. As when developing throught the project, the function can get more and more complex. So keeping things straightforward and focusing on creating small, unique functionalities has been key to the project's success. By breaking down tasks into small components, we can ensure a smoother development process.
